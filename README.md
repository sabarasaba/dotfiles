## Installation

### Basics
Clone and run `./setup.sh`

NOTE: we assume that i3wm is already installed.

### Installing Vim Plugins
To install them you'll need vim-plug, as mentioned above.
Once Plug is installed. Open vim (`$ vim`) and type `:PlugInstall`. And then restart vim. You'll need to do this for all the plugins to work.
